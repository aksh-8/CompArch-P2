# CompArch-P2
Effect of cache configurations on CPU performance

## Description
- Simulated x86 CPU architectures with different cache configurations using the Gem5 computer system simulator
- Automated the simulaiton process using python scripts on 4 different runtimes parallely
- Calculated **CPI** from the observed results for all cache configurations simualted
- Studied the results to find the Optimal cache configuration with the lowest **CPI** 
- Finally, devised a unction to optimize the *performance v/s cost* trade-off
